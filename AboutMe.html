          <h2>Who is BiggyJ_Dev?</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Jordan Wilson, and I love building Responsive React
            Applications. Changing careers in 2021 from construction and not
            knowing where to start I hit youtube and started to learn HTML, CSS
            and Javascript and wow... did I fall in love! It would be a lie to
            say I have never coded before, I actually played around with Python
            in high school and my ICT lecturer begged me to stay and do A-Level
            computer science but I was too interrested in Forensics which is why
            I left to study forensic science... I don’t have to tell you how
            that worked out considering I left college with at trade instead.

          <h2>Why React?</h2>
          <p>
            It’s simple. Being from construction I love the concept of the
            application being a house and the components being the bricks used
            to build it with. Just because I use react doesn’t mean I am not
            open to learning other frameworks

          <h2>Where did BiggyJ_Dev come from?</h2>
          <p>
            Growing up I wasn’t always the slim handsome bloke you seen on the
            left. I was actually a really big lad tipping the scales at 20
            stone... Jheez big, I know right? It was a nick name I picked up and
            I kinda liked so it has always stuck. I think the dev part is pretty
            self explanitory. Other than coding I still hit the gym quite
            regulary as we all know the saying ‘Health is Wealth’ or something
            along them lines...
